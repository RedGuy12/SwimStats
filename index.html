		<p>
			Please note that I only have access to one Team Unify site, and I have no idea how much
			it differs from other Team Unify sites. It might differ a lot, or it might not differ at
			all. I don't know. So, unforunately, these instructions might not work, depending on how
			your Team Unify site works.
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Go to your team's page on Team Unify.</li>
			<!--<li>
				Determine the team identifier (the string of random letters in
				the URL). Some examples:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<code
							>https://www.teamunify.com/Home.jsp?team=reczzatst</code
						>
						-> <code>reczzatst</code>
					</li>
					<li>
						<code
							>https://www.teamunify.com/team/illtfst/page/home</code
						>
						-> <code>illtfst</code>
					</li>
				</ul>
				Type it into the first box.
			</li>-->
			<li>Sign in.</li>
			<li>Go to your "My account" page.</li>
			<li>Click on the "Members" tab.</li>
			<li>
				Right-click on the swimmer you want to generate statistics for and choose "View
				image", "Open image in new tab", or the equivalent for your browser.
			</li>
			<li>
				Find the swimmer ID (the series of random numbers typically at the end of the URL).
				Some examples:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<code
							>https://www.teamunify.com/rest/ondeck/member/photo/cdn/reczzatst/4305991</code
						>
						-> <code>4305991</code>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Click "Generate stats!"</li>
